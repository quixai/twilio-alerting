# Disclaimer
 
We do highly recommend to utilize the Docker environment in the linux because of the differences in the distributions. In order to do this please look to the README_Docker.md .
 
# Python
Currently tested to work with [3.8.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-387/), but other python versions of 3.7 and 3.8 are expected to also work.

# PythonNet dependencies installed and configured for Ubuntu 20.04
- Install Mono version 6.10.0
    ```
    sudo apt install gnupg ca-certificates
    sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 3FA7E0328081BFF6A14DA29AA6A19B38D3D831EF

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install mono-devel
    ```  
    for other linux distributions, please see https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/#download-lin and https://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/linux/#accessing-older-releases

- Additional things to install:
    ```
    sudo apt install python3-pip clang libglib2.0-0 build-essential librdkafka-dev
    python3 -m pip install pycparser
    ```
    As of writing this document, some dependencies do no correctly install for librdkafka on ubuntu 20.04. These need to be manually installed with the following script, as not available pre-built.
    ```
    mkdir kafkadownloads
    cd kafkadownloads
    curl http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/g/glibc/multiarch-support_2.19-18+deb8u10_amd64.deb -O
    md5=$(md5sum multiarch-support_2.19-18+deb8u10_amd64.deb | cut -b 1-32)
    if [[ "$md5" != 'c3146eaa5ba5f757d1088b5217c2a313' ]]; then
    echo "Invalid Md5Hash for multiarch-support: $md5" 1>&2
    exit 1
    fi
    dpkg -i multiarch-support_2.19-18+deb8u10_amd64.deb

    curl http://security.debian.org/debian-security/pool/updates/main/o/openssl/libssl1.0.0_1.0.1t-1+deb8u12_amd64.deb -O
    md5=$(md5sum libssl1.0.0_1.0.1t-1+deb8u12_amd64.deb | cut -b 1-32)
    if [[ "$md5" != "02124c56a3fa64ab3f9a225f450dc0ac" ]]; then
    echo "Invalid Md5Hash for libssl: $md5" 1>&2
    exit 1
    fi
    dpkg -i libssl1.0.0_1.0.1t-1+deb8u12_amd64.deb
    cd ..
    rm -rdf kafkadownloads
    ```


# Create new python environment
We highly suggest to use a python virtual environment, as the Quix streaming package currently relies on some dll redirecting, which is achieved by adding a file to your python environment. This is done automatically, but to avoid any complication with other python applications you might want to use relying on similar techniques, a virtual environment is advised.

To create a new virtual environment, execute the following in a terminal at your desired location:
```
python3 -m pip install virtualenv
python3 -m virtualenv env
chmod +x ./env/bin/activate
source ./env/bin/activate
```
You will know you succeeded in activating the environment if your terminal line starts with (env). Future steps will assume you have the virtual environment activated or happy to install into global python.

# Install samples requirements
In the same terminal you activated the virtual environment, navigate to the folder where `requirements.txt` is located and execute
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt --extra-index-url https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/quix-analytics/53f7fe95-59fe-4307-b479-2473b96de6d1/_packaging/public/pypi/simple/
```

# Run the sample 
In the same terminal you activated the virtual environment, navigate to the folder where `main.py` is located and execute
```
python3 main.py
```

# Known issues
#### 1. No such configuration property: "client.software.name".
This happens when an old version of librdkafka is picked up or some dependencies are not fulfilled. Please make sure you have followed "Additional things to install" section of this guide. If the issue still persists, please let us know.

When reporting issue to support@quix.ai, please include the result of following commands:
```
cat /etc/os-release
ldd ./env/lib/python3.8/site-packages/quixstreaming/dotnet/linux-x64/librdkafka.so
```
